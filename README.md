### In this project we will focus on detecting genders of twitter user by their tweet written in portuguese language  
## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- re
- nltk
- sklearn
- xgboost
- lightgbm

## Methodology
- After cleaning the dataset we will vectorize the texts
- split the data into train and test dataset
- then we will feed the data into three different ML models
- we will perform hyperparameter tuning to increase the performance of the models
- finally we will evaluate the model performance

## Result
### Naive bayes proved to be the best performing ML algorithm with an accuracy of 64.18%
